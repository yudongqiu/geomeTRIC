This example calculation will run the checkFiniteDifference functions
on the provided input (H2O + H2O2).

First, the IC analytic gradient will be calculated, then compared to
numerical gradients calculated from finite difference on the energy.

Next, the Cartesian Hessian will be calculated numerically using finite
difference on the Cartesian gradient, then analytically transformed into ICs.

Finally, the IC Hessian will be compared to numerical IC Hessian elements
calculated from finite difference on the IC gradient.

The system is chosen to be non-redundant in the primitive internal coordinates
because that improves the stability of numerical gradients. The structure
is not fully minimized in order to keep contributions from the B't*Gq term.
